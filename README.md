# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies to users based on various criteria such as genres, ratings, or similarity to other movies. The system uses Python and its data manipulation libraries to analyze and process movie datasets.

## Features
- **Dataset Handling**: Reads and processes movie data from a CSV file.
- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocesses movie titles to remove special characters for consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Displays initial insights from the dataset.
- **Recommendation Algorithms**: (To be implemented) Generates movie recommendations based on collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/movie-recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Ensure the dataset file `movies.csv` is in the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook mycodee.ipynb
   ```
3. Explore the dataset and implement additional features for recommendations.

## Dataset
- The project uses a CSV file (`movies.csv`) containing:
  - `movieId`: Unique identifier for each movie.
  - `title`: Title of the movie.
  - `genres`: Genres associated with the movie.

## Example
### Initial Dataset Preview
| movieId | Title                          | Genres                                    |
|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Toy Story (1995)              | Adventure|Animation|Children|Comedy|Fantasy |
| 2       | Jumanji (1995)                | Adventure|Children|Fantasy                  |
| 3       | Grumpier Old Men (1995)       | Comedy|Romance                            |

### Cleaned Title Function
```python
import re

def clean_title(title):
    title = re.sub("[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]", "", title)
    return title

# Example
clean_title("Toy Story (1995)")
# Output: 'Toy Story 1995'
```
